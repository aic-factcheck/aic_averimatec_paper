\section{Introduction}
TODO: averitec 2024 proved that factchecking can be done on long text with proprietary blackbox llms averitec 2 2025 showed that it can also be solved using open-weights models on reasonable resources, this year's AVerImaTeC shared task~\cite{cao2025averimatecdatasetautomaticverification} extends the challenge to its multimodal settings, providing .

We have scored 3rd place with a simple pipeline that performs RAG with two retrieval modules, one retrieving offline knowledge store evidence based on textual similarity, other retrieving texts published alongside a similar image using a blackbox reverse image search model -- Google Lens, in our case.
