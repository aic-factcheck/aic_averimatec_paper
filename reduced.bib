  year =          {2024},
  abstract =      {Existing datasets for automated fact-checking have
                   substantial limitations, such as relying on
                   artificial claims, lacking annotations for evidence
                   and intermediate reasoning, or including evidence
                   published after the claim. In this paper, we
                   introduce AVERITEC, a new dataset of 4,568 real-world
                   claims covering fact-checks by 50 different
                   organizations. Each claim is annotated with
                   question-answer pairs supported by evidence available
                   online, as well as textual justifications explaining
                   how the evidence combines to produce a verdict.
                   Through a multi-round annotation process, we avoid
                   common pitfalls including context dependence,
                   evidence insufficiency, and temporal leakage, and
                   reach a substantial inter-annotator agreement of κ =
                   0.619 on verdicts. We develop a baseline as well as
                   an evaluation scheme for verifying claims through
                   question-answering against the open web.},
